# IoTeX Ecosystem
This repository is the data source for the IoTeX Ecosystem page, located at https://github.com/iotexproject/ecosystem.

# Contributing Guidelines
A project is composed of two files: a Markdown file with headers, and an image. To add a new project to the ecosystem page, create both a new Markdown file in the projects directory and add a new image in the img directory.

!Important!: Should your Project already exist within this repo, refrain from creating a new Markdown file in the projects directory! Rather adapt your old one in a new PR. Same goes for changed images or Logos for your Project.
